                    <p>Firstly, where would I be without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:2024%E2%80%9325_in_European_football_(UEFA)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. That's the source of all the information - well, really it's places like <a href="https://www.rsssf.org/" target="_blank">RSSSF</a> or the Football Association's and Archive pages that are conveniently collated into Wikipedia. I grabbed all that data, put it through various scripts to clean the data a little for my own purposes, and used even more scripts to build fancy(ish) looking pages to display that information. So, let's get into the rules:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The ESL only takes into account teams competiting in their nation's top flight. Get relegated, and you are removed from next season's ESL.</li>
                        <li>To make things easier, only top flights that consisted of a single division are included. Leagues that had a knockout format, or used regional leagues before a final tournament, don't count. That's because the maths is too complex, and it's a bit tricky to work out who is the best team if not all teams have played the same amount of games.</li>
                        <li>The exception to that rule is when the league splits into Championship and Relegation rounds. Those are counted. However, a single game relegation play-off is not as it is effectively a "cup game".</li>
                        <li>Despite any local and historical rules, the ESL always counts a win as 3 points. Draws are 1, and defeats are 0. This includes such rules as 2pts for a win, bonus points for winning by 3+ goals, settling games with penalties (they are counted as draws), or draw limits.</li>
                        <li>Rules for classification are: 1) Points per game; 2) Goal Difference per game; 3) Win Percentage; 4) Goals scored per game; 5) Total goals scored; 6) Total wins;</li>
                        <li>The ESL is divided into 8 Divisions. Each Division will have, at most, 100 teams.</li>
                        <li>At the end of each season, 10 teams are relegated to the next Division down. Any team removed due to relegation from their national top flight are counted in this 10. Teams from the next Division down will be promoted and take their place for the following season.</li>
                        <li>New or Returning teams are added to the lowest Division with space, based on the Classification amongst those teams with the best Classified teams being added first. This may result in some new and returning teams being added to different Divisions. They are then put in the appropriate positions based on their Classification within that Division.</li>
                        <li>If a team is given a points deduction (or bonus), the same points adjustment is applied to the ESL. If the adjustment is listed as "2 points", then 2 points are deducted; if the adjustment is listed as "1 win", then 3 points are deducted, regardless of the local and historical points system in place at the time of adjustment.</li>
                        <li>Any bans enforced by UEFA to individual clubs or nations as a whole are not enforced here. This is because this is a bit of fun, and nothing to do with UEFA.</li>
                        <li>As some national leagues take part in a single year, these are added to the season before the winners would appear in UEFA competitions. For example, the 2023 Icelandic top flight had it's winner qualify for the 2024-25 Champions League - it is therefore added to the 2023-24 ESL season.</li>
                        <li>Clubs that are merged together are classed as completely new clubs. They do not inherit the position of one of the clubs it merged with, and will instead start as a "new" team, entering in the lowest available Division.</li>
                    </ul>
